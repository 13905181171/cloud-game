## Feature
1. Cloud gaming: Game logic is hosted on a remote server. User doesn't have to install or setup anything.
2. Cross-platform compatibility: The game is run on webbrowser, the most universal built-in app. No console, plugin, external app or devices are needed. The device must support webRTC to perform streaming.
4. Emulator agnostic: The game can be play directly without emulator selection and initialization as long as the its cores are supported by RetroArch.
3. Vertically scaled + Load balancing: We can add more machines to handle more traffic. The closest server with highest free resource will be assigned to user.
5. Cloud storage: Game state is storing on online storage, so you can come back to continue playing in a game.
